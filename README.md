## ztream - A mplayer/mpv streamer 'controller' script written in Z-shell.

ztream was written as a small shell in learning shell mechanics. I intended
for it to be POSIX-compliant, but the associative array data structure made 
z-shell MUCH more appealing. 

You can configure some of the behavior by modifying the global variables above
the 'fold'. 

#### TODO:
  
- parameter handing to all the user to skip selecting an action
- interacting with the underlying process? (this might require standardizing on a backend)
- ???
- PROFIT!
