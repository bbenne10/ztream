## ztream - A mplayer/mpv streamer 'controller' script written in Z-shell.

ztream was written as a small excercise in learning shell mechanics. I intended
for it to be POSIX-compliant, but the associative array data structure made 
z-shell MUCH more appealing. 

You can configure some of the behavior by modifying the global variables above
the 'fold'.
